# Commodore's Vestures Improved

(Formerly "Show Premium Cosmetics on your Operatives")

Ok, some pretty huge upgrades to the Commodore's Vestures shop this time.

Commodore's Vestures Improvements aims to bring a range of QoL improvements to the Commodore's Vestures in Darktide.

You will be able to view any item (including bundles of items) for any class in Commodore's Vestures (The premium shop) DIRECTLY on your characters without having to switch characters.

For example, you load in as your beloved Ogryn, but want to view Veteran cosmetics?

Well in the default game, you will not be able to preview those items on your character.

With this mod installed, you will be able to see those items on your Veteran without logging in as them...

Even works with multiple characters of the same class, allowing you to switch between them all at will.

Give it a go, and you'll understand what I mean ;D
